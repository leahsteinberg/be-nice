david nolen ---> dom diffs --> what was that??. seemed cool.
I started working with React like....
	5 days ago.
	
	But it's the sort of thing I had my eye on for a while and it was cool to actually try it.
	
	I had tried D3 and I loved the idea of binding an array or dictionary and being able to just see it.
	
	React is great if you don't already have a way of thinking about HTML/javascript. 

		Don't have to make things by hand! (using jquery) (teaches you how to think about your data)

WHY I LIKE IT:
	React lets you think about things both logically and visually at the same time (which I love!)

WHAT IT IS:
	React is a framework for the browser that helps you design how you're going to make your "DOM manipulations".. which are usually "expensive", but React calculates how to make the minimum changes
so it's less expensive to do this. <<<<< DOM DIFS >>>>>

	React has things called COMPONENTS, which I guess are like HTML divs, but also like objects.
- Components hold other components, and the mushy stuff on the inside of components is basically raw-ish HTML.
- components are a set of function, the most important is render

So the main things I have learned about react is:
	Data flows DOWN!
	Events bubble UP!

Components have two types of information:

	this.state - your "database"
		- should be held in your high-up object
		- state can flow down into the lower objects, I have usually done this
			by passing in state to the child objects 
		- this should some up the state of the program... 

	this.props - "properties"
	 	- inherited / set by parents
	 	- doesn't change (I think?), or at least doesn't often change
